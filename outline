For our project of Continuous Integration in the Cloud, we will be designing an application that can be downloaded to any computer which will allow programmers to program on one operating system, have the application run and test the program in the operating system is it to be put into production on, and once it passes all tests push it directly to the cloud.
Our application will do this by combining a virtual machine with Jenkins, a java based continuous integration tool that tests code, and a containerized operating system, or systems with which the program being tested will run on, on a single image that will automatically bind to the code being worked for real time testing and implementation.
The scope of this project will consist of working with at least two different languages that the application will be able to function with.
The things our group will need to explore are the languages we will be using in the containers of the image, how containers work and the Docker software, the Jenkins software itself, the Vagrant virtual machine, and our mentor also instructed us to read ‘The Phoenix Project’ for more information of Dev. Ops which deals with the later part of our application when code is sent to the cloud for production/implementation.
The users of this application will be software developers; primarily Mac users as that is what Vagrant if catered towards. But once we are successful with two languages, we will strive for success with other languages as well as virtual machines.
